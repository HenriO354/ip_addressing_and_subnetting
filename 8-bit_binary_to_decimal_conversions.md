#   How to convert decimal numbers to binary

Let's look at two cases - converting decimal integers to binary.

<u><b>Decimal integers to binary</b></u>: Algorithm

Step 1. Divide the integer by 2, while noting the quotient and remainder.

Step 2. Then, divide the quotient again by 2, and record the 3rd quotient and remainder.

Step 3. Like this, keep dividing each successive quotient by 2 until you get a quotient of zero.

Step 4. After this, just write all the remainders in reverse order to get the binary representation of the integer.

For example, let's convert the integer 15 to binary. Divide the integer by 2 successively while noting the quotient and remainder.

Next, write the all the remainders in reverse order. In this example, remainders are 1, 1, 1, 1. So, writing in reverse order, the number 15 in decimal is represented as 1111 in binary.

For an even integer, let's take the example of 10.

So, the decimal number 10 is represented as 1010 in binary.
